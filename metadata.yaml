description: The Practical Distiller was first published in 1809 when spirit distillation
  was legal in the United States. It describes the methods for making whiskey and
  other forms of liquor from the 1600's onward. This book has some unique stories
  about some of the old distilleries, and explains many things that were no doubt
  helpful to the brewers of that day. Section one discussed yeast, how to know when
  it is good or bad, how to renew it when it is sour, and the best yeast for daily
  use. A second sect.
